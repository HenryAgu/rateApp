## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- javaScript

### What I learned

I learnt to use arrow functions directly in the addlistener of a button.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```js
    rateButtons[i].addEventListener("click", ()=>{
        save = rateButtons[i].innerHTML;
    })
```
